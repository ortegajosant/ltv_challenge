## Additional Questions
1. Are there any suggestions you could make about the structure of our data?
	- Some column names could be more descriptive, For example: changing the columns `Genre` to `GenreId`, `Song` to `SongName` or just `Name`.
	- Add one more table which could be named `Artists` and change the `Songs` table column named `artist` to `ArtistId`. Then, you can associate a lot of songs with the same artist.

2. What fields would you index in these tables?
	- The tables would be like:
		1. `Songs`:
			1. `Id`		
			2. `ArtistId`	
			3. `GenreId`	
			4. `Name`
			6. `Length`	
		2. `Genres`:
			1. `Id`
			2. `Name`
		3. `Artists`:
			1. `Id`
			2. `Name`
